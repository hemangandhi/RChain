# Why don't we take Reddit and put it over there

This is an ugly frontend for Reddit on the blockchain.
Everything sorta works and we need to test it with
more users.

Here are the useful links, because there are a couple
essential parts:
 - [The python library, reconfigured for this.](https://github.com/hemangandhi/arky)
 - [The blockchain hosting: a node in NodeJS.](https://github.com/hemangandhi/ark-node)

A `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` and then `python3 RChain/rcHAIN.py` should do the trick.
But you'll have to have installed the host locally because right now there isn't a global
RChain.
